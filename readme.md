## About
This app works with [Home Assistant](http://hass.io) to let you control your smart home! It was made as part of the [Rebble Hackathon](https://rebble.io/hackathon-001)

## Why?

There are only two 'Home Assistant' apps on the [Rebble app store](https://apps.rebble.io), and neither supports the basic functionality of home assistant such as turning lights on and off, viewing sensor data and enabling/disabling Automations

- Lights:
  - View a list of all light entities
  - Toggle them quickly
  - Control the brightness and colour temperature
- Switches (and more):
  - List your switches & other entities
  - Quickly toggle switches
  - Control media player (volume/play/pause/power)
  - Control timers (view/start/stop/pause)
  - Control vacuums (start/stop/return to home)
  - Control Locks (lock/unlock)
- Sensors:
  - View sensors and their values
  - Go into extra details to see all attributes
  - Quickly refresh their values
- Scripts:
  - View and trigger scripts
- Scenes:
  - View and trigger scenes
